A (simple) throttling UDP server for volume control with the ALSA C library.

Linux only.

Not including the HEADER GUARDS (*_h.h), the *.h and *.c files can all be used
with the gcc commands listed in the first few lines in the file to produce a
command line tool that can be used to test the code in that file. Some of these
command line tools are useful on their own, like "msleep" and "set-volume".

Command-line tools:

    * server - UDP server (volumectl) controls volume with ALSA

    * client - UDP client, updates the volume by messaging the volumectl server

    * set-volume - set the volume using ALSA

    * msleep - sleep for a number of milliseconds

You can also use

    node client.js <VOLUME>

to update the volume.

You can move the system unit file into the right directory (probably), but first
creating the right directory if it doesn't exist, with the following
commands:

mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system && mv volumectl.service /etc/systemd/system
